## Setup

Prerequisites needed:
  - [Node 12 or better](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [Covalent API key](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/#/auth/register/)
  - [MySQL server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)

Steps to set the Backend running:
1. set your DB user and password in .env (DB_USER, DB_PASS);
2. set Covalent api key in .env (COV_API);
3. install npm dependencies;
4. run the project with the command $ npm start;
5. database and tables creation is automatic, leave it for a while to fetch & update the NFTs and stats.

Steps to set the Client running:<br>
1) move the client folder in the same directory as the server folder;
2) make sure you do not have anything running on port 3000;
3) install the Node dependencies by running $ yarn start in the terminal;
4) insert in the package.json file the following key value pair, right above "dependencies": "proxy": "http://localhost:8080" and save the changes;
5) open a new terminal and run the command $ yarn start (make sure you are in the right directory);
6) fill in the ```.env``` with the Unstoppable Domains credentials.

## Workflow

1. Fetching collections NFTs (metadata) and saving them in DB.
2. Fetching NFTs transactions and saving them in DB.
3. Creating algorithms for stats and charts and schedule updater for the DB data.
4. Creating APIs for the frontend.
5. Fetching the stats from the backend.
6. filling the charts and stats with data fetched.

## Design

The main reasons for the design choices can be organized into three categories, as follows:

- Draw user attention: since thereâ€™s a lot of psychology that goes into the thinking about where users look, all elements are arranged, including text, left to right and top to bottom, because the audience tends to scan pages that way;

- Use a common pattern: the application was build mobile-first and by making use of popular Media Queries Breakpoints considering that users are accustomed to this pattern;

- Simplicity: within the application the goal was to reduce all work to the essential and using less to do more with the help of a few elements to achieve maximum effect;
